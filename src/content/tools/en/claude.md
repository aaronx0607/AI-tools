# Claude

Claude is a sophisticated AI assistant developed by Anthropic, designed to be helpful, harmless, and honest. With its advanced natural language understanding, exceptional reasoning capabilities, and strong safety features, Claude represents one of the most capable conversational AI systems available today.

## Main Features

### Natural Conversational Abilities
Claude excels at natural, human-like conversations that feel authentic and engaging. The assistant can understand nuanced requests, maintain context across long exchanges, and respond with appropriate tone and style. This makes interactions with Claude feel more like conversations with a knowledgeable colleague than with a typical AI system.

### Superior Context Understanding
One of Claude's standout capabilities is its ability to comprehend and maintain context across extensive conversations. The assistant can analyze and work with up to 200,000 tokens (approximately 150,000 words) in a single conversation, allowing users to discuss complex topics, analyze lengthy documents, or engage in detailed problem-solving sessions without losing track of important details.

### Multimodal Capabilities
Claude can process and understand not just text but also images and documents, making it a versatile tool for various tasks. Users can upload images for Claude to analyze, share PDFs for discussion, or ask it to interpret charts and graphs. This multimodal functionality expands Claude's utility across different use cases and workflows.

### High Factual Accuracy
Claude is designed to provide information that is accurate, well-sourced, and transparent about its limitations. When uncertain, the assistant will acknowledge the limits of its knowledge rather than providing potentially incorrect information. For topics it is knowledgeable about, Claude can provide detailed, nuanced explanations with exceptional clarity.

### Constitutional AI Framework
Developed with Anthropic's Constitutional AI approach, Claude is built with robust safety guardrails and ethical considerations at its core. This framework helps ensure Claude remains helpful while avoiding potentially harmful, unethical, or misleading outputs, making it suitable for enterprise and sensitive use cases.
