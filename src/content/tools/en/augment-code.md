# Augment Code

Augment Code is an advanced AI-powered coding assistant designed specifically for development teams. It provides deep understanding of entire codebases, enabling developers to ask questions, troubleshoot bugs, and implement new features with AI assistance that truly understands the context of their projects.

## Main Features

### Deep Codebase Understanding
Augment Code analyzes your entire repository to build comprehensive context awareness, allowing it to provide more accurate and relevant code suggestions than tools limited to file-level context. This enables it to understand complex dependencies and relationships across your codebase.

### Team Collaboration
Built with teams in mind, Augment Code facilitates collaboration by providing a shared AI assistant that understands your team's codebase and can assist multiple developers simultaneously. This creates a consistent experience across the team and helps maintain coding standards.

### Slack Integration
Augment Code integrates directly with Slack, allowing developers to interact with the AI assistant without leaving their communication platform. This enables real-time code assistance, answering questions about system operations, and detailed technical discussions right within Slack.

### Repository-Wide Recommendations
The platform can recommend changes across your entire repository, identifying opportunities for improvement, refactoring, and optimization that might be missed when focusing on individual files.

### Unlimited AI Usage
Unlike many competitors with token-based pricing, Augment Code offers unlimited AI usage on paid plans, allowing developers to work without worrying about hitting usage limits or incurring unexpected costs.
