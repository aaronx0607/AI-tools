# Roo Code

Roo Code is an open-source autonomous AI coding agent that functions as a VSCode extension, designed to code, debug, and evolve software systems with minimal human intervention. It mimics a junior developer's workflow through a cyclic process of planning, editing, running, and debugging code.

## Main Features

### Multi-Model Support
Roo Code supports a wide range of AI models and providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Azure, and local models via LM Studio or Ollama. This flexibility allows developers to choose the most appropriate model for each task based on capabilities, cost, and performance.

### Custom AI Modes
One of Roo Code's standout features is its support for custom modes that allow users to shape the AI's persona, instructions, and permissions. Developers can create different modes for various tasks, such as a "Code" mode for routine development, an "Architect" mode for system design, or specialized modes for specific frameworks or languages.

### Terminal Integration
Roo Code can execute terminal commands directly, allowing it to run tests, start servers, install dependencies, and perform other command-line operations as part of its autonomous workflow. This enables end-to-end development tasks without requiring manual intervention.

### Browser Automation
The agent includes browser automation capabilities, allowing it to interact with web applications, test frontend functionality, and even debug live websites. This extends its usefulness beyond just code editing to full-stack development and testing.

### Cost Tracking
Roo Code monitors token usage and costs for each session, providing transparency and helping developers manage their API expenses. This is particularly valuable given the pay-per-use pricing model of most AI APIs.

## Use Cases

1. **Autonomous Development**
   - Creating new features with minimal guidance
   - Implementing specifications from natural language descriptions
   - Refactoring and optimizing existing code

2. **Learning and Exploration**
   - Understanding unfamiliar codebases
   - Experimenting with new frameworks and libraries
   - Generating example code for learning purposes

3. **Debugging and Testing**
   - Identifying and fixing bugs
   - Creating comprehensive test suites
   - Validating functionality across the stack

4. **Pair Programming**
   - Collaborating with the AI on complex problems
   - Getting alternative approaches and perspectives
   - Accelerating routine development tasks

## Pricing Model

Roo Code itself is completely free and open-source, with no subscription fees. However, users pay for the API tokens consumed by their chosen AI models. Costs vary depending on:

- The AI models and providers selected
- The complexity and frequency of coding tasks
- The efficiency of prompts and workflows

To optimize costs, Roo Code can be configured to:
- Use different models for different types of tasks
- Implement efficient prompting strategies
- Leverage local models for certain operations

Many users pair Roo Code with services like Requesty that offer optimization features to reduce token usage, potentially cutting costs by up to two-thirds in some scenarios.

As an open-source project, Roo Code benefits from community contributions and continuous improvement. Its flexible architecture and customization options make it particularly appealing to developers who want complete control over their AI coding assistant while leveraging the power of multiple models and providers.
